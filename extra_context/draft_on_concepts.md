## summary for game purposes:

T1 - read the intent, 0ms
T2 - window to safe parry/bind/void
T3 - risky window to deflect (and counter later) after the attack is commited

## VOR / Sante

VOR - an Action that demands an Answer

```
If you swing your sword wildly out of measure, you are not in the Vor. You are simply wasting time, and your opponent can ignore it.
```

#### T1: Initiative Before Initiative (Sen no Sen).

**Meaning:** To seize the initiative the instant your opponent's intention to attack is perceived, but before their physical action has begun.

**The Action:** You attack while your opponent is still in the preparation or planning phase (the "mental wind-up"). You interrupt their plan before it leaves the runway.

**Game logic:** T1 stage that either an amateur is projecting or an expert swordmaster is reading. Invisible for amateur vs amateur. timing 0ms right after the attack is clicked. Fist window for defender to act.

**Analogy to HEMA:** This is the most refined and ideal version of the Vor.

#### T2: Simple Initiative (Sen or Sante)

**The Action:** A committed, decisive, and threatening attack that forces your opponent to address your weapon immediately, preventing them from carrying out their own attack.

**Timing:** A clear Vor phase action. You are attacking sooner than they attack you.

**Game logic:** T2 stage. Attacker has the initiative. You need to go on the defense probably parry (or be extremely fast to strike first)

**Analogy to HEMA:** This is the practical definition of the Vor in the Liechtenauer tradition: "The Vor is that you shall always come before with a strike or stab to his opening, sooner than he comes to you, so he must parry you."

##### T3: Go no Sen (後の先) - Initiative After

**Meaning:** Literally "Initiative after the fact," or Counter-Initiative. This is the art of intentionally yielding the initial attack to the opponent, only to neutralize it and counter-attack immediately.

**The Action:** The opponent commits to their attack, and you respond with a robust defense (a parry, block, or evasion), ensuring their attack fails or is deflected, followed by an immediate, decisive counter-strike (the riposte). You use their forward commitment against them.

**Timing:** You wait until the opponent's attack is fully committed and in motion, then you intercept or deflect it at the point of greatest danger (the moment it is about to land).

**Analogy to HEMA:** This is the primary action of the Nach (After) phase. You allow them to execute the Vor against you, and you successfully execute the Nach against them.
