Telegraph Phase,Emergency Defense,Move Backwards,Parry,Deflection,Feint (Attacker)
Telegraph 1: Initiation: low certainty,Eyes widen suddenly,Weight shifts to back foot,Eyes lock on opponent's blade,Eyes lock on opponent's blade,Shoulders tens up
Telegraph 2: Early Wind-Up,"Arms flail upward chaotically, blade position erratic, shoulders hunch defensively","Hips pull backward, torso leans away, back leg muscles tense","Blade begins moving deliberately to specific line (high/low, left/right), shoulders adjust to brace for impact","Blade moves with purpose to SPECIFIC angle (clearly committing to one attack type), hips rotate to optimal deflection position",Shoulders shift suddenly
Telegraph 3: Active Motion,"Fighter stumbles, off-balance, vulnerable (already in recovery)","Front foot lifts, clear backward movement, blade maintains guard but disengages","Blade positioned on interception line, arms locked/braced, clear defensive structure","Blade at perfect intercept angle, body coiled for sweeping motion, point already aimed at opponent's opening",balade path changes
Telegraph 4: Completion,Deep recovery - regaining composure and stance,"Fighter lands at new distance, blade still up but no threat","Blades clash, both fighters in bind, pushing/testing for advantage","Success moment: Blade makes minimal contact, opponent's weapon slides harmlessly aside, immediate riposte",New trajectory established
