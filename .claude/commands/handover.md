We made a lot of progress. I want you to write a handover document for an ai coding agent that will come after you but will have no memory of what the project is.
Create a handover document in the root with name yyyymmdd_handover.md (e.g. 20251110_handover.md)
Recommend a reading list with exact file names.

to understand the most important things that were implemented. create
20251110_handover.md. You can use c:\Projects\MyRPG\20251108_handover.md as an inspiration. The new handover document is supposed to be standalone so copy the parts from the old handover docuemnt  
 that are still relevant
