We made a lot of progress. I want you to write a handover document for an ai coding agent that will come after you but will have no memory of this project or the codebase. They will need to understan what the project is about and how to navigate it. They will need to understand the agreements between us that might have been in the chat history.

1. Create a handover document in the root with name yyyymmdd_handover.md date is today, if another file like that exists add underscore and next sequential number (e.g. 20251110_handover_2.md)
2. New handover document is supposed to be standalone. Read the last handover document available in root and use it as your starting point.
3. Include a folder and file tree
4. In the handover document you will include a reading list for the new AI coding agent. These will be a list of files with exact path and name and a very short description of what they are. The new AI coding agent will learn by about the project by reading them.
5. Give most imporant pointers and breadcrumbs to help new ai onboard faster tot the new project
6. Short learning for the future if you did something that didn't work so that the next coding agent will not repeat same mistakes.
7. Summarize your agreements with me, (e.g. if you asked me claryfying question and I chose an option make a note of the choice I made).
8. Most importantly summarize what you have been working on. It's like a PR.
9. Include Next Steps sections divided into `Features waiting for implementation (with plan)`, `Feature wwiting for implementation(without plan)` and `Started tasks that needs to be finished`.

I want the most up to date state.
