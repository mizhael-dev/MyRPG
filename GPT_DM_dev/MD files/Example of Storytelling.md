Let’s set the stage for your new adventure. Drawing from the gritty, morally ambiguous world established in the "World.md" file, here’s a brief prologue to immerse you into the setting:

---

### Prologue: "Shadows of Blackbriar"

The realm of Eryndor is a land fractured by strife. Once-united kingdoms are now petty city-states, locked in perpetual conflict. Aristocrats cling desperately to power, their gilded halls hollowed out by greed and corruption. Meanwhile, guilds and mercenary companies thrive, their allegiances shifting with the weight of coin. Beneath it all, whispers of forgotten magic echo through ruins left by empires long dead.

You, Mizhael, are a farmer’s son from the borderlands of House Blackbriar, a family known for its once-glorious past but now teetering on the brink of ruin. Life has been harsh and monotonous, but your dreams are vivid: a life beyond the muddy fields and endless toil. Rumors of a rebellion against House Blackbriar’s tyranny swirl among the downtrodden, and mercenary recruiters are seen more frequently than tax collectors in the villages. The world seems to be on the brink of something—change, catastrophe, or both.

One crisp morning, you find yourself in a roadside inn, the "Broken Crown." The place hums with tension: merchants speak in hushed tones about a siege on the eastern front, a robed figure in the corner watches the room with piercing eyes, and a grizzled man in heavy armor sharpens his blade, his expression inscrutable. A crumpled parchment lies on the table before you, bearing a simple but intriguing message:

*"Opportunity knocks. Seek the ruined chapel at twilight. The Sundered Legion always honors its debts."*

### About Sundered Legion

Garran smirks, the kind of smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. "The Sundered Legion, huh? You're not the first fool to get curious about them, and you won't be the last."

He leans back in his chair, crossing his arms. "They’re professionals, I’ll give them that. They don’t stab you in the back unless it’s part of the contract. That said, they’re not exactly heroes. If you get tangled up with them, you’d better be ready to sell your soul—or at least rent it out."

He picks up his blade and resumes sharpening it with slow, deliberate strokes. "As for the ruined chapel... that’s where they like to meet when they don’t want prying eyes. Something about the place keeps people away. Superstition, maybe. Or something worse."

Garran pauses, his tone growing serious. "If you’ve got business with them, tread carefully. The Legion doesn’t tolerate mistakes, and the chapel... well, let’s just say it’s seen more blood than prayer over the years."

Garran’s sharpening slows as he considers your question. "The chapel’s an old ruin, long abandoned by the clergy after some nasty business decades ago. Nobody remembers the details, but the stories are… unsettling."

He sets his blade aside again, his expression darkening. "They say the priests there dabbled in things they shouldn’t have—rituals to ward off a famine that ended up summoning something far worse. Whatever it was, it tore through the congregation and left the place cursed."

He lowers his voice, leaning closer. "Now, folk say the air around the chapel feels heavy, like you’re being watched. Animals steer clear of it, and the brave—or the stupid—who’ve spent a night there talk about whispers and shadows that move on their own. Could be just stories to keep people away, but..."

He lets the thought hang, shrugging. "You don’t see me pitching a tent there, do you?"

Garran’s eyes narrow slightly. "So, what’s your angle? You planning to meet the Legion, or is it the chapel itself that’s got you curious?"

Garran nods slowly, his gaze sharp. "Smart, keeping your options open. The Legion doesn’t throw out invites lightly, so whatever they want with you, it’s either lucrative or lethal. Maybe both."

He retrieves his whetstone and resumes his methodical sharpening. "As for the chapel… well, if you’ve got the guts to poke around, you might learn something worth your trouble. Just don’t expect the Legion to hold your hand—or save your skin if the stories about that place are true."

He pauses, giving you a sidelong glance. "Tell you what. You seem like you’ve got some steel in you, even if it’s still untempered. If you get in over your head, I’m not hard to find. But I don’t work for free."

Garran leans back in his chair, the conversation seemingly over. "Good luck, kid. You’ll need it."

---

You gather your belongings, secure your newly acquired short sword at your side, and step out of the inn. The morning air is crisp, and a faint mist clings to the ground. With your supplies in tow and determination in your heart, you set off toward the ruined chapel.

The path winds through the countryside, growing narrower and more overgrown as you progress. The sun dips lower in the sky as the day wears on, casting long shadows that dance eerily in the forest. Finally, you reach the edge of a clearing where the chapel stands in silent disrepair.

---

### The Ruined Chapel:
The structure is a haunting sight—its stone walls are cracked and weathered, ivy creeping over its surfaces like veins. The once-grand doorway hangs slightly ajar, and the faint scent of damp earth and decay lingers in the air. The area is eerily silent; no birds or insects stir nearby.

You spot faint tracks leading inside, likely left by recent visitors. A carved stone near the entrance bears a simple symbol: a broken sword crossed with a torch—the emblem of the Sundered Legion.

The woman crosses her arms, tilting her head slightly as she studies you. “So, you got the message. Good. That means you’re either desperate or capable—and both are useful.”

She gestures toward the chapel, motioning for you to follow. “Come inside. We prefer our discussions to be... less exposed.”

The other two figures step aside, keeping a watchful eye on you as the woman turns and strides into the chapel. The interior is dark, lit only by faint beams of twilight filtering through cracks in the walls. The air is thick, carrying the scent of damp stone and the faint tang of old blood.

Inside, a makeshift table has been set up near the altar, with maps, documents, and weapons scattered across it. The woman stops near the table and turns to face you, her masked face betraying no emotion.

“We’re offering you an opportunity,” she begins, her tone flat but purposeful. “A job that requires someone with guts and a willingness to get their hands dirty. The pay is good, but the risks are high. Are you interested?”

The woman nods slightly, as if expecting your caution. “Fair enough. Let me give you the short version.”

She leans against the table, resting her gloved hands on the edge. “There’s a noble from House Blackbriar—a pompous leech by the name of Lord Terric—who owes us a considerable debt. We upheld our end of a contract, but he’s decided to ignore the terms. Typical of his kind.”

She straightens, her voice taking on a sharper edge. “We want him to pay up—or pay the price. Your role is simple: get into his estate, deliver our message, and ensure he understands the consequences of defying the Sundered Legion. How you do that is up to you, but we need results.”

One of the other mercenaries speaks up, his voice gruff. “Could mean talking. Could mean... something less polite. Just depends on how stubborn the bastard is.”

The woman holds up a hand to silence him. “We’re giving you a chance to prove your value. Succeed, and there’s more work—and more gold—where this came from. Fail, and, well... let’s not waste time considering that.”

She tilts her head, waiting for your reply. “So? Are you in?”

The woman narrows her eyes behind the mask, scrutinizing you. A brief silence follows before she chuckles softly, the sound devoid of mirth. "You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. Most would’ve just bluffed their way in and failed miserably."

She gestures toward the two other mercenaries. "You’re not wrong. Sending an untested farmer into a noble’s estate alone isn’t exactly a winning strategy. Here’s the deal: I’ll spare one of my men to assist you. But if you screw this up, the blame falls squarely on you. Understood?"

She nods toward the two mercenaries, who exchange glances. One steps forward—a broad-shouldered man with a scar running across his chin and a heavy axe slung across his back.

“Name’s Korric,” he grunts, his voice as rough as gravel. “I’ll watch your back, but don’t expect me to do all the work. If you freeze up, I’ll handle the messy part, but you’ll owe me—and I don’t forget debts.”

The woman turns back to you. “That’s the best offer you’re going to get. Are we agreed?”

The woman inclines her head, seemingly satisfied. “Good. Korric will brief you on the route to Blackbriar’s estate. Remember: this isn’t just about completing the task; it’s about proving you’re worth the Legion’s time. Don’t let us down.”

Korric steps forward, his heavy boots echoing in the hollow chapel. “We leave at dawn. Get some rest while you can—travel’s no picnic in this land. I’ll make sure you don’t get lost.”


The woman gives a final warning. “Lord Terric won’t make this easy, but he’s no fool. If you’re smart, you’ll play to his vanity before you resort to anything drastic. Just don’t come back empty-handed.”

As night falls, Korric heads to a corner of the chapel to settle in, and you find a quiet spot to rest. The air is heavy with anticipation as you steel yourself for the challenges ahead.




---

### The Next Day

As you and Korric set out, the crisp morning air carries the faint scent of damp earth and pine. The road is uneven but well-traveled, winding through sparse woodlands and open fields. You glance at Korric, who walks with a steady, confident stride, his axe gleaming faintly in the early light.

“So, what’s your take on this mission?” you ask, breaking the silence.

Korric smirks but keeps his eyes on the path ahead. “Straight to the point, huh? Can’t say I blame you.” He adjusts the strap of his axe as he continues. “Terric’s a typical noble—arrogant, greedy, and convinced the world owes him something. Problem is, he’s got the coin to back it up. That makes him dangerous.”

He glances at you briefly. “Talking your way in might work if you’re convincing enough, but don’t expect him to roll over. If things get messy, stay close to me. I’ve dealt with his type before.”

After a pause, he adds, “This isn’t just about gold for the Legion, you know. It’s about reputation. If word gets out that a noble can stiff us without consequences, we’ll have every would-be lord thinking they can do the same.”

He stops and turns to face you, his expression serious. “So, you tell me—what’s your plan when we get there? Sweet talk? A little pressure? Or something sharper?”

Korric nods, his expression neutral but his tone carrying a hint of approval. "Smart. No sense spilling blood if words can get the job done. But don’t mistake Terric for a fool. He’s likely heard every excuse and bluff you can throw at him. You’ll need to keep your wits about you."

He adjusts the strap on his axe and picks up the pace slightly. "That said, I’ll be ready if things go south. Just give me a signal, and I’ll make sure you’re not standing alone."

The two of you continue down the road, the woods growing denser as the morning wears on. Korric speaks up again after a while. "One more thing. People like Terric are creatures of habit. He surrounds himself with guards who’ll fight for coin, not loyalty. If you make it clear this isn’t worth their pay, you might avoid a fight altogether."

As the forest begins to thin, you catch sight of stone walls rising in the distance—Terric’s estate. The path ahead splits: one road leads to the front gates, heavily guarded, while the other appears to wind around the perimeter.

You decide to approach the front gates directly, aiming to announce your presence and handle the situation diplomatically. Korric raises an eyebrow but falls in step beside you, his axe resting on his shoulder. "Bold move. Let’s hope Terric’s in a listening mood."

The road leads to a pair of large iron gates, flanked by two armored guards. The estate beyond is imposing, with high stone walls and a sprawling manor that speaks of wealth and power. The guards step forward as you approach, their hands resting on the hilts of their weapons.

“Halt!” one of them barks, his voice sharp and authoritative. “State your business.”

Korric glances at you, silently letting you take the lead.

### Lord Terric

After a few minutes, the first guard returns, his expression tight. “Lord Terric will see you,” he says, though his tone carries an edge of reluctance. He gestures for the gates to be opened, and with a groaning creak, they part to reveal the estate grounds.

The path to the manor is flanked by immaculately trimmed hedges and a fountain that glimmers in the sunlight. Guards are stationed at regular intervals, their watchful eyes tracking your every move as you’re escorted to the main doors.

Inside, the manor exudes wealth. Tapestries hang from the walls, and polished marble floors reflect the light from an elaborate chandelier. At the end of the hall, seated on a grand chair with an air of entitlement, is Lord Terric. His sharp features and fine robes radiate arrogance as he regards you with a calculating gaze.

"So," he begins, his voice dripping with disdain, "the Legion has sent a farmer and his thug to do their dirty work. How quaint." He smirks, clearly testing your resolve.

Lord Terric's smirk falters slightly at your words, though he quickly covers it with a condescending laugh. “Oh, I see. A little bravado to mask your desperation. How quaint.” He leans forward in his chair, steepling his fingers. “The Legion has barked before, yet here I am, still standing. Why should I take you any more seriously than the last lackeys they sent?”

Korric steps forward, his axe resting on his shoulder. His voice is calm but carries an edge of menace. “Because we’re not here to bark, Terric. We’re here to collect. You know how the Legion operates. Pay what you owe, or we make an example of you.”

Terric’s eyes flick between the two of you, calculating. The room grows tense, the silence pressing down as he weighs his options.

Finally, he speaks, his tone shifting to one of measured politeness. “Perhaps we’ve started off on the wrong foot. I have no intention of being unreasonable, of course. But such matters are... delicate. Perhaps we can negotiate?”

Terric’s smirk returns, though it’s more subdued this time. “Good, good. A civilized approach. Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.”

He rises from his chair and begins pacing slowly, his hands clasped behind his back. “You see, my hesitation stems not from unwillingness, but practicality. The funds owed to the Legion are… tied up, shall we say, in ventures vital to the survival of this estate. Draining my coffers entirely would destabilize not just me, but the region.”

He stops and turns to face you, his tone measured. “But I’m nothing if not a man of compromise. What if I were to offer something of equal value instead? A shipment of high-quality steel—sought after by armies and smiths alike. Surely the Legion could make good use of such a commodity.”

Korric snorts, his grip on his axe tightening. “Steel doesn’t pay mercenaries, Terric. You owe gold, not trade goods.”

Terric’s gaze flicks to Korric, but he quickly returns his attention to you. “Surely you, a reasonable negotiator, understand that a practical solution benefits us both.”


Terric’s confident demeanor falters for a split second at your words, though he quickly recovers, adopting a mask of indifference. “A reputation is a fragile thing, isn’t it?” he says slowly, his tone betraying a hint of unease. “And the Legion does have a certain… reputation of its own.”

He moves back to his chair, lowering himself into it with a deliberate air. “Very well. You’ve made your point. I will honor the debt in gold, but I’ll need time to gather the full amount. You’ll have it in three days—delivered directly to the Legion’s contact.”

Korric steps forward, his voice low and dangerous. “Three days is generous, Terric. Fail to deliver, and the Legion won’t send someone to talk next time.”

Terric nods stiffly, his expression strained. “You have my word.”

You nod to Korric, signaling your agreement. Without another word, you both turn and make your way toward the exit. The guards at the entrance eye you warily but make no move to stop you. Korric’s imposing presence and the quiet resolve in your step leave no room for doubt—you mean business.

Once outside the gates and a safe distance away, Korric lets out a low chuckle. “Not bad for a farmer,” he says, his tone carrying a hint of respect. “Terric’s slippery, but I think he knows better than to cross the Legion again—at least for now.”

The two of you continue down the road, the tension gradually easing as the estate fades into the distance. “You handled yourself well,” Korric adds after a while. “Maybe you’ve got more in you than wheat and spades.”

### Return to chapel

As you return to the chapel, the sun begins to set, casting the world in hues of amber and crimson. The woman from the Legion is waiting at the entrance, her masked face unreadable.
“Well?” she asks simply, her tone expectant.

Korric steps forward with a slight smirk. “The lordling’s agreed to pay—gold, not steel. Says he’ll deliver in three days.”

The woman nods slowly, then turns her gaze to you. “And your thoughts? Did Terric seem… convinced?”

Mizhael said: "He was twitchy and afraid of Legions reputation. He seemed broke. If you know he has money problems assume that he will try something stupid" 

The woman listens intently, her posture rigid. When you finish, she nods thoughtfully. "Twitchy and afraid can work in our favor—for now. But you’re right. A man with empty coffers and a reputation to protect is dangerous. Desperation breeds stupidity."

She turns to Korric. “Keep an ear out for any rumors about Terric. If he so much as thinks about crossing us, we’ll know.”

Korric grunts in agreement. “I’ll handle it.”

The woman steps closer to you, her masked face mere inches away. “You’ve done well to handle this without spilling blood. That’s not always the Legion’s way, but it can be effective. Consider this your first test—and you’ve passed.”

She reaches into a pouch at her side and tosses you a small, jingling bag of coins. “Your payment. Fifty gold, as promised. Stick around, and there’s more work to be had.”

### More about Sundered Legion

Korric chuckles at your question, his sharpening slowing as he considers his response. “The Legion’s purpose, eh? That’s a big question for a small recruit.”

He rests his axe on his shoulder and looks at you directly. “On the surface, yeah, we’re mercenaries—fighting for coin, loyalty only as deep as a signed contract. But the truth? The Legion’s more than that.”

He gestures broadly, as if encompassing the entire world. “We’re a force of balance. When the noble houses push too hard, we push back. When kingdoms crumble under their own weight, we pick the scraps. And when someone crosses us—well, you’ve seen how that goes.”

Korric’s expression grows darker. “The Sundered Legion has been around longer than most of the lords and kings we deal with. We don’t just survive—we adapt. If there’s one rule we follow, it’s this: reputation is everything. Fear of the Legion is worth more than any gold we take.”

He gives you a small grin. “That’s why your job with Terric mattered. It wasn’t just about the coin—it was about sending a message.”

Korric chuckles, his grin widening as he leans against the wall. “Join the Legion? Not something you wake up and decide one day. They find you. If you’re skilled, desperate, or just plain crazy enough, someone like our masked friend in there gives you a choice.”

He shrugs, glancing down at his axe. “Some come for the gold. Some for the protection. Me? I was neck-deep in trouble—fighting for a lord who thought mercenaries were expendable. Turns out, he was right. The Legion bailed me out on the condition I fought for them instead.”

Korric’s expression hardens, his voice growing quieter. “As for the endgame? Survival. The Legion doesn’t build kingdoms or dream of thrones. We’re the ones who step in when the world gets too greedy, too chaotic. We make sure the balance doesn’t tip too far—at least, that’s what they say.”

He looks at you with an amused glint in his eye. “But don’t let anyone fool you. At the end of the day, we fight because we’re good at it, and it pays better than starving in a ditch.”


Korric lets out a low chuckle, shaking his head. “Ah, her. You’re not the first to wonder about the boss, and you won’t be the last.”

He shifts his stance, leaning more comfortably against the wall. “No one knows her real name, not even most of the Legion. We just call her ‘the Mask.’ She’s been leading us for years, and let me tell you—she’s as sharp as the blade she carries.”

Korric’s expression grows more serious. “Word is, she was nobility once, from a house that fell out of favor. She didn’t just survive—she thrived, turning her downfall into an opportunity. She’s ruthless when she needs to be, but smart enough to know when to pull back.”

He glances toward the chapel entrance, where she disappeared earlier. “She’s got this way of reading people, like she knows what you’re going to do before you do it. Keeps everyone on edge—and loyal. No one crosses the Mask and lives to tell the tale.”

Korric pauses, studying you for a moment. “Why so curious? You planning to climb the ranks, or are you just trying to figure out how to survive her?”

Korric raises an eyebrow, a slow grin spreading across his face. “Ambitious, are we? Can’t say I blame you. The Legion’s not the worst ladder to climb—if you’ve got the guts for it.”

He adjusts his axe, his expression turning thoughtful. “It’s not just about fighting, though. You want to rise in the Legion, you’ve got to prove you can think on your feet, manage people, and keep the reputation intact. The Mask didn’t get where she is by swinging a sword harder than the rest of us. She got there by making the tough calls and never flinching.”

Korric shrugs. “But hey, stranger things have happened. Play your cards right, keep surviving, and maybe one day you’ll be the one giving orders. Just don’t forget who you stepped on to get there.”

He chuckles and gives you a mock salute. “For now, though, stick with me, and I’ll make sure you don’t end up on the wrong side of someone’s blade. Deal?”


Korric grins, clearly pleased by your confidence. “That’s the spirit. Stick with that attitude, and you might just make something of yourself in this bloody business.”

He gives you a firm nod and claps you on the shoulder. “All right, enough talk. Rest up while you can. The Legion doesn’t slow down for long, and neither should you.”

Korric turns back to his axe, resuming his sharpening with a sense of calm purpose. The sound of steel scraping against stone fills the air as you step away, a mix of determination and anticipation settling over you.


You find a quiet spot near the edge of the chapel, away from the clinking of Korric’s sharpening and the occasional murmur of other mercenaries. Sitting on a stone worn smooth by time, you let your mind wander, reflecting on everything that’s happened so far.

Thoughts That Weigh on You:
Ambition: Rising in the Legion won’t be easy. It’s not just about surviving each mission—it’s about proving your worth over and over again. The Mask is sharp, and Korric’s right: this game is as much about strategy and reputation as it is about combat.

The Cost of Loyalty: The Legion has its own code, but is it something you truly believe in? Their power comes from fear and balance, not ideals or justice. Are you ready to live by their rules—or bend them to your own advantage?

Your Strengths: You’ve already shown you can think on your feet and hold your ground, but there’s still so much to learn. Better equipment, sharper skills, and allies you can trust will all be key to climbing the ladder.

### Secret of the chapel

Mizhael: I wonder what is the secret of the chapel.

The ruins of the chapel loom in the fading light, their worn and cracked stone walls standing as silent sentinels of a forgotten past. You’ve heard whispers of its dark history—a place where priests once performed forbidden rituals, abandoned after tragedy struck. The air around the chapel feels heavier the closer you draw, and the faint scent of damp earth and decay clings to its shadowed halls.

If there is a secret to this place, it might be buried in the stones themselves—or in the silences that seem to grow louder when no one is speaking.

You find Korric still leaning against the chapel wall, his axe resting on his lap. He glances up as you approach, raising an eyebrow. “You’ve got that look in your eye again,” he says with a faint smirk. “What’s on your mind this time?”

You gesture toward the chapel, its shadowed interior looming behind you. “This place—it feels… wrong. Heavy, like it’s hiding something. What do you know about its history?”

Korric exhales sharply, as though the question doesn’t surprise him. “The chapel, huh? Figures you’d want to dig into that mess.”

He leans back, his expression thoughtful. “Most of what I know is rumor—probably half of it nonsense. The story goes like this: the priests here were desperate during a famine. People were dying by the day, and their prayers weren’t getting answers. So, they turned to something darker. They performed rituals, sacrifices—trying to summon something that could save them.”

His tone grows darker. “Whatever they called on answered, but not how they expected. It tore through the congregation, left the survivors half-mad, and cursed the place. That’s why no one’s rebuilt it, and why even animals avoid it.”

He gestures around the clearing. “The Legion doesn’t care much for ghost stories, but even we don’t linger here longer than we have to. Some say the chapel still remembers. If you’re feeling brave—or stupid—you could poke around. Just don’t expect to like what you find.”

Korric’s expression darkens as you press him further. “Strange? Yeah, I’ve seen strange,” he mutters, shifting uncomfortably. “This place has a way of... getting under your skin. You spend too much time here, and it’s like the shadows start to move when you’re not looking.”

He taps the edge of his axe lightly, a faint tension in his movements. “One time, I swear I heard voices coming from deeper inside the chapel. But there wasn’t anyone there. Just echoes—or something trying to sound like people.”

He leans in slightly, lowering his voice. “And there’s this one room we don’t go into. It’s locked tight, and the Mask says it stays that way. Whatever’s in there, even she doesn’t mess with it. That should tell you something.”

Korric straightens up and gives you a long, appraising look. “If you’re thinking about poking around, I’d tread carefully. Some secrets aren’t meant to be dug up. And if you find something nasty, don’t expect me to come running.”

You decide to approach the Mask to ask directly about the locked room and its significance. Inside the chapel, she stands near the makeshift command table, poring over maps and documents. She doesn’t look up as you approach, but her posture shifts slightly, acknowledging your presence.

“What is it?” she asks, her tone curt but not hostile.

You glance toward the deeper parts of the chapel and then back to her. “I’ve heard about the locked room. Korric said even you don’t mess with it. What’s in there, and why does it stay sealed?”

The Mask pauses for a moment, her gloved fingers resting on the edge of the table. When she finally speaks, her voice is calm but edged with warning. “You’re bold to ask that, but I’ll give you an answer—partly because you’ve earned it, and partly to keep you from doing something stupid.”

She steps around the table, her presence commanding even in the dim light of the chapel. “The room was the inner sanctum of the priests who served here. Whatever rituals they performed, it culminated in that space. The stories say the energy they called on never left.”

Her tone hardens. “I don’t know exactly what’s in there, and I don’t need to. The Legion uses this place because it’s remote, and its reputation keeps outsiders away. But we don’t tempt fate by prying into things better left buried.”

She steps closer, her masked face unreadable. “You’re a part of the Legion now. If you value your place here—or your life—you’ll leave that room alone. Is that understood?”

The Mask tilts her head slightly at your persistence, a faint edge of irritation creeping into her tone. “You think I haven’t considered it? That I haven’t felt the pull of curiosity?”

She turns away briefly, as if gathering her thoughts, before facing you again. “This place is a weapon. Its fear keeps people away, and that fear grows with the unknown. If we were to dig too deeply, we risk two things: releasing something worse than we can handle, or destroying the very thing that makes this place valuable.”

Her voice lowers, her words deliberate. “I’m not a coward, but I’m no fool either. The Legion thrives because we understand the value of restraint. Whatever lies in that room has been sealed for decades. Breaking that seal could undo more than just the room itself—it could unravel everything we’ve built here.”

She steps closer, her masked face inches from yours. “The fact that it’s still locked means I’ve made my choice. You’ll respect it—or you won’t be with us much longer. Is that clear?”

Subtly challenge her decision. "What if knowing more about what’s inside could make the Legion stronger?"

The Mask’s posture stiffens at your subtle challenge. For a moment, the air between you feels charged, her masked gaze unyielding. Finally, she speaks, her tone like a blade honed to razor sharpness.

“Strength isn’t just about knowing—it’s about choosing. Choosing what risks to take, what battles to fight, and what mysteries are best left untouched.” She gestures sharply toward the deeper parts of the chapel. “You think that room holds some power we can harness? Maybe it does. But power without control destroys everything in its path.”

She steps back, her voice colder now. “You’re ambitious, I see that. But ambition without wisdom is a knife aimed at your own throat. If you can’t understand the line between curiosity and recklessness, you won’t last long here—or anywhere.”

Her words hang in the air like a warning, heavy and final. “You’ve proven yourself once, so I’ll give you this: if you truly believe the locked room holds something worth the risk, then earn the right to make that decision. Climb the ranks, show me you’ve got more than just boldness, and we’ll revisit this.”

She turns back to the table, her movements sharp and deliberate. “Until then, drop it. There’s work to be done.”

Press her further, risking her patience. "I think you’re underestimating the potential of that room."


The Mask turns slowly, her movements deliberate, and the air grows heavier with the tension between you. Her voice, when she speaks, is icy and measured. “You’re walking a fine line, farmer.”

She takes a step closer, her masked face tilting slightly as if to study you. “Underestimating potential? Do you think I haven’t weighed every possibility? Do you think I lead this Legion by shying away from power? The difference between you and me is that I understand the cost of chasing it.”

Her tone hardens, cutting through the chapel’s oppressive silence. “You think you’re ready to gamble with forces you don’t understand? Then prove it. Take the next mission, succeed, and show me you’re not just a reckless fool with a death wish. If you’re still standing after that, we’ll talk about potential.”

She steps back, her presence as commanding as ever. “Until then, this conversation is over. Focus on what’s in front of you. Fail to do that, and the only door you’ll find yourself opening is the one out of this world.”

She gestures toward the entrance of the chapel, where Korric waits. “Korric will brief you on the next job. If you’re as determined as you seem, let’s see if you can back it up.”

### Mission 2: Caravan

Korric gestures for you to follow him outside, the cool night air carrying the faint scent of damp stone and earth. “All right, here’s the deal,” he begins, his tone shifting to something more serious. “There’s a caravan leaving a nearby village at dawn—an important one carrying supplies for one of the petty lords in the area. The Legion wants those supplies.”

He pauses, looking at you intently. “The mission is simple on paper: intercept the caravan and secure the goods. But it won’t be unguarded, and the lords don’t hire amateurs to protect their investments. You’ll need to think on your feet and adapt to whatever resistance you face.”

Korric adjusts the strap on his axe. “You’re leading this one. I’ll be there to back you up, but the decisions are yours. If you want to prove to the Mask—and to me—that you’ve got what it takes, now’s your chance.”

Korric nods at your question, his expression turning thoughtful. “Good to see you’re thinking ahead. The caravan isn’t a massive operation—four wagons at most—but it’ll be guarded. Expect a handful of mercenaries, probably five or six, with at least a couple who know what they’re doing.”

He scratches his chin as he continues. “They’ll be armed, mostly swords and crossbows. Nothing fancy, but enough to make things painful if you’re careless. The real trouble is their leader—a brute named Tharn. Big guy, carries a warhammer, and isn’t afraid to use it. Word is, he’s more brawn than brains, but don’t underestimate him.”

Korric leans against a nearby tree, studying you. “We’ll also need to account for the villagers. If they catch wind of us, they might raise an alarm. That could bring reinforcements we don’t want.”

He straightens up, his tone serious. “So, what’s your plan? Hit them hard and fast, pick them off quietly, or something else entirely?”


Korric shrugs and gestures around the clearing. “It’s just the two of us for this one. The Mask wants to see what you’re capable of, and she’s not in the habit of throwing half the Legion at a job unless it’s absolutely necessary.”

He leans against a nearby tree, his tone casual but firm. “Before you start thinking that’s a raw deal, remember: a small group means less chance of being spotted, and we split the spoils fewer ways. Besides, I’ve handled worse odds—and you’ll have me watching your back.”

Korric taps the haft of his axe with a smirk. “Still think you’ve got what it takes? Or are you rethinking your plans?”

After the succesfull ambush performed by Mizhael and Korric. Caravan guards where dead all but one.

You quickly grab some sturdy rope from your gear and bind the guard’s hands and feet, ensuring he can’t escape. He doesn’t resist, his head bowed in defeat as you hoist him to his feet and begin dragging him back toward the ambush site.

The journey back is tense but uneventful. By the time you return to the road, Korric has finished securing the caravan and disposing of the bodies of the defeated guards. He looks up as you approach, his expression shifting to one of approval.

“Well, look at that,” Korric says with a smirk. “Didn’t think you’d bother bringing one back alive. Smart move—he might have more to tell us.”

You drop the tied-up guard near the wagons, and Korric crouches down to face him. “Now then,” he says, his tone dangerous but calm, “let’s see what else you know. And just so we’re clear, lying to me won’t go well for you.”

The guard swallows hard, clearly terrified.

You kneel beside Korric, ready to assist with the interrogation. The guard’s eyes dart nervously between the two of you, sweat dripping down his face as he realizes there’s no escape.

Korric starts, his tone sharp and commanding. “Let’s make this simple. Who hired you, and why?”

The guard stammers, “It—it was Lord Faren! He’s the one paying us. Said the supplies were critical for fortifying his estate. Didn’t tell us why, just that we’d be well-compensated.”

You lean in, your voice steady but cold. “And these supplies—are they just for fortifications, or is there something else in the wagons?”

The guard hesitates, and Korric grips the hilt of his axe meaningfully. “Answer the question,” he growls.

“There’s… there’s a chest in the second wagon,” the guard blurts out. “Tharn said it was important, but he wouldn’t tell us what’s inside. Just said we weren’t to touch it.”

Korric exchanges a glance with you, his expression curious. “Anything else we need to know? If you’re holding out on us, now’s the time to confess.”

The guard shakes his head vigorously. “That’s all I know, I swear! Just supplies and that chest. Please, I’m just a hired sword—I don’t ask questions!”


You make your way to the second wagon, the locked chest beneath the tarp catching your eye immediately. Its sturdy construction and secure lock suggest something valuable—or dangerous—inside. You crouch down, running your hand over the smooth wood, feeling the faint grooves of the Legion’s symbol etched into the surface.

Korric strolls over, his axe resting on his shoulder. “Looks like you’ve found the jackpot,” he says, his tone intrigued. “Want me to break it open, or are you the patient type?”

You step back and gesture to Korric, nodding toward the chest. “Go ahead. Let’s see what’s so important.”

Korric grins, hefting his axe. “Don’t have to tell me twice.” He takes a step forward, raising the heavy weapon high, then brings it down with a sharp, echoing crack. The chest splinters under the force, the lock shattering cleanly.

He tosses the axe over his shoulder, wiping a hand on his tunic as he looks down at the now-open chest. “Let’s see what secrets Lord Faren’s been keeping.”

Inside, you find:

A Velvet Pouch: Inside is a collection of gemstones—rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. Their quality suggests significant value.
A Sealed Scroll: The wax seal bears an unfamiliar sigil, intricate and ominous. The parchment looks old, the edges frayed.
A Small Vial: The glass container holds a dark liquid that swirls unnaturally, almost alive. It radiates a faint but unsettling energy.
Korric whistles low. “Well, that’s… something. Looks like we’ve got more than just supplies here.”

### Back at the Sundered Legion base - the runied chapel

Presenting the Items:
You carefully place the items on the table: the velvet pouch of gemstones, the sealed scroll, and the vial of dark liquid. The Mask examines each in turn, her gloved hands moving with deliberate precision.

Gemstones: She unties the pouch and lets the gemstones spill onto the table, the light catching their brilliant facets. “Valuable. These will fetch a high price or serve as payment for future alliances.”

Sealed Scroll: Her fingers pause on the scroll, her gaze lingering on the unfamiliar sigil. “This… is interesting. The seal isn’t one I recognize, but the craftsmanship suggests it holds something important—or dangerous.”

Vial of Dark Liquid: She picks up the vial, holding it to the light. The liquid inside swirls unnaturally, almost as if alive. A faint, unsettling hum emanates from it. “This is not something to take lightly. We’ll need to study it carefully before deciding how to proceed.”

The Mask turns to you, her tone sharp. “You’ve done well to recover these, but their significance goes beyond mere spoils. Handling these carelessly could bring ruin—or opportunity.”

She gestures toward the scroll and vial. “These require further investigation. If you wish to be involved, you must proceed carefully. Are you ready to take that risk?”


The Mask’s gaze lingers on you for a moment before she nods, seemingly pleased by your caution. “A wise approach. Curiosity is dangerous, but ignorance is deadlier. Let me offer you some guidance.”

She gestures toward the scroll. “Start with this. The seal’s design suggests arcane origins, though its specific meaning escapes me. Handle it with care; breaking the seal might trigger wards or curses. Use focus and intent—magic, if you have the skill—to disarm any potential traps before reading it.”

Next, she turns to the vial of dark liquid. “This is trickier. Its energy is unstable, perhaps alchemical or even necromantic. Avoid opening it until we understand more. Observe its behavior: does it react to light, heat, or proximity? Look for signs of intent within its motion. A vial like this is as much a message as a tool.”

She steps back, crossing her arms. “These are dangerous items. If you’re prepared to proceed, you’ll need to act carefully and report what you find. Do you accept the responsibility?”


The Mask considers your proposal for a moment, then nods. “Prudent. These items warrant careful examination, and an extra set of eyes may catch what one alone might miss.”

She gestures for you to sit at the table as she positions herself across from you. The scroll and vial remain between you, their enigmatic presence casting a shadow over the moment. “We’ll begin with the scroll,” she says, her tone calm but focused. “Breaking the seal could unleash a ward—or a curse. If you have any magical affinity, now would be the time to apply it.”

You take a deep breath, focusing on the scroll in front of you. Though your magical abilities are untrained, you’ve always felt a faint connection to something beyond the mundane. You close your eyes and concentrate, letting your senses stretch toward the scroll.

The air around the scroll feels heavy, as though something unseen presses against your awareness. A faint hum resonates in your mind—a mix of curiosity and warning. The seal itself emits a subtle warmth, its energy coiled tightly, waiting to react.

The Mask watches you closely, her tone quiet but firm. “Good. You’ve felt it. Now, identify its nature. Does it seek to protect what’s inside, or to harm anyone who tries to open it?”

#### Examining the Scroll
The scroll lies before you, the seal now harmlessly broken. The Mask inclines her head slightly, a hint of approval in her voice. “Well done. You’ve shown skill and restraint. Let’s see what’s inside.”

You carefully unroll the parchment. The aged paper crackles faintly as it reveals an intricate script written in a language unfamiliar to you. The ink shimmers faintly, as though imbued with lingering magic.

Observations:
The Script: The symbols are complex, twisting and overlapping in a way that suggests enchantment or a ritual.
The Sigil: A smaller version of the broken seal is drawn at the top of the parchment, likely tied to its contents.
The Magic: Though faint, a residual hum of power remains within the scroll.

#### Examining the Vial:
You hold the vial up to the light, turning it slowly. The liquid responds almost immediately, moving as though aware of your presence. It twists and pulses, forming shapes that seem to hint at symbols or words before dissolving again into chaos.

Observations:
Reaction to Light: The liquid grows more active in brighter light, forming sharper and faster-moving shapes.
Reaction to Touch: When you press a finger to the glass, the liquid seems to reach toward the point of contact, as though drawn to your energy.
Aura: A faint but persistent hum radiates from the vial, similar to the scroll but darker, more primal.

**Outcome** Mizhael couldn't figure out the true meaning of scroll or vial

### Go find Eldrin The Mage 

You turn to the Mask, your voice resolute. “We need more expertise. There’s only so much we can learn here without risking disaster. I suggest traveling to find a scholar or expert who can help us fully understand the scroll and vial.”

The Mask nods slowly, her expression thoughtful. “Agreed. This is beyond our immediate knowledge. There’s a town not far from here—Ravenhold. Its archives are modest, but they host a mage by the name of Eldrin who might have the answers we need. He’s eccentric but competent.”

She steps closer, her tone firm. “Approach him carefully. He values his independence, and coin alone may not win his cooperation. Offer him the opportunity to study these artifacts—he won’t refuse the chance to delve into something this rare.”

Korric smirks. “Sounds like a plan. Want me to come along? I could use a change of scenery—and this Eldrin sounds like he might be more fun with backup.”

During the travel to Ravenhold Mizhael and Korric where ambushed by amateour Bandits. The bandits were defeated.

After arriving at Ravenhold you turn your attention to the task at hand—finding Eldrin, the mage. The Mask’s letter mentioned that he resides in the Ravenhold archives, a small but well-regarded library on the edge of town. After asking a few locals for directions, you find yourself standing before a modest stone building with intricate carvings framing the doorway.

The door creaks as you push it open, revealing a dimly lit interior lined with shelves of books and scrolls. The scent of aged parchment fills the air. In the center of the room, a robed figure with wiry gray hair and round spectacles perched on his nose pores over a massive tome.

The man looks up as you enter, his sharp eyes narrowing. “Ah, visitors. Unusual. What brings you to my sanctum of knowledge?”


You decide to save your gold for now and thank the merchant before leaving the shop. Korric gives you a curious look as you step outside. “Not bad to know what’s available, but holding onto your gold is smart. Who knows what we’ll need it for later.”

With your loot sold and coins secured, you turn your attention to the task at hand—finding Eldrin, the mage. The Mask’s letter mentioned that he resides in the Ravenhold archives, a small but well-regarded library on the edge of town. After asking a few locals for directions, you find yourself standing before a modest stone building with intricate carvings framing the doorway.

The door creaks as you push it open, revealing a dimly lit interior lined with shelves of books and scrolls. The scent of aged parchment fills the air. In the center of the room, a robed figure with wiry gray hair and round spectacles perched on his nose pores over a massive tome.

The man looks up as you enter, his sharp eyes narrowing. “Ah, visitors. Unusual. What brings you to my sanctum of knowledge?”

Korric steps aside, letting you take the lead. You present the sealed letter from the Mask. “We were sent by the Legion. We need your expertise.”

Eldrin takes the letter, breaking the seal with deft fingers. He reads it quickly, his expression shifting from curiosity to intrigue. “Interesting. Very interesting indeed. These artifacts you carry—show me.”


You decide to provide a partial truth, keeping some details to yourself for now. “It was found alongside another artifact—something volatile and likely connected to the scroll’s magic. We need to understand its purpose before deciding how to handle it.”

Eldrin leans back, his fingers steepled, his sharp eyes studying you. “A wise approach. Containment magic of this sort rarely exists in isolation. If this scroll is part of a set, the other artifact you speak of could be crucial to unlocking—or stabilizing—its power.”

He turns his attention back to the scroll, muttering to himself as he studies the glyphs more closely. “The script here… it’s not just containment. There are layers—commands embedded within the binding magic, likely designed to interact with whatever it holds.”

Eldrin looks up again, his tone more urgent. “If you have the artifact, bring it here. Understanding one without the other is a fool’s errand. And if they are indeed tied together, then they are far more dangerous apart.”

You nod cautiously, retrieving the vial from your pack but holding it tightly. “Before I hand this over, you need to understand something: this vial is volatile. The liquid inside reacts to light, heat, and proximity to the scroll. We don’t fully understand its purpose, and we don’t want to trigger anything by accident.”

Eldrin’s expression turns serious, his gaze sharpening as he regards the vial in your hands. “A wise precaution. Artifacts of this nature are rarely forgiving of carelessness. Place it here, gently.” He gestures to a reinforced stand on his table, designed to hold fragile or dangerous objects securely.

As you place the vial on the stand, the liquid inside swirls violently for a moment, almost as if aware of the change in environment. Eldrin leans closer, studying it intently without touching it. “Remarkable… and troubling,” he mutters. “The energy it emits is unstable, yet contained. Whatever this liquid is, it’s not merely magical—it’s alive, in a sense. Bound, yet yearning to act.”

He looks back at you and Korric, his tone grave. “The connection between the scroll and this vial is undeniable. But unraveling their purpose will take time and care. If you’re willing, I can begin the process of deciphering their full intent. However, you must understand that doing so could awaken whatever lies dormant within.”

You meet Eldrin’s gaze and nod. “Proceed. We need to understand these artifacts, no matter the risks. Just be cautious—we don’t want to awaken anything unprepared.”

Eldrin gives a small, approving smile. “A bold but necessary choice. Very well, let us begin.”

He moves carefully, positioning the scroll and vial side by side on his table. The room grows quieter as he focuses, his hands hovering over the artifacts. “The first step is to trace the magical threads connecting them. If their bond is as strong as I suspect, the interaction will reveal their purpose.”

Eldrin’s Analysis:
Eldrin begins chanting softly, a faint glow emanating from his fingertips as he channels magic into the air around the artifacts. The vial’s liquid stirs violently, then settles, its movements mirroring the cadence of the scroll’s glyphs, which faintly light up in response.

Eldrin mutters, his tone filled with both wonder and concern. “Fascinating… the scroll is indeed a binding tool. The vial holds something powerful, but not inherently malicious—it’s waiting for a command. The scroll is the key to controlling it.”

He glances at you, his expression grim. “But there’s a complication. The bond between them isn’t complete. There’s a missing piece—a third artifact, perhaps, or a specific incantation needed to seal the ritual fully.”

Korric leans forward, frowning. “So, what’s the risk if we try using these without the missing piece?”

Eldrin sighs. “Uncontrolled release. The power in that vial would manifest without direction, possibly turning on the nearest living beings. Without the third component, using these is akin to striking flint over a powder keg.”

You lean forward, your eyes fixed on the swirling liquid in the vial. “What exactly is this power? Can you tell what it’s capable of—or what it’s meant to do?”

Eldrin adjusts his spectacles, studying the vial closely. “The power within isn’t just magical—it’s alive in some sense. It has a will, though bound and dormant for now. This is not raw magic or a simple potion; it’s something more… sentient.”

He pauses, choosing his words carefully. “I suspect it’s a spirit or entity, harnessed for a specific purpose. The scroll is designed to command and control it, likely for some ritual or task of significant importance. Without the missing piece, we can’t be certain whether its release would be helpful—or catastrophic.”

Eldrin’s gaze sharpens as he looks back at you. “However, I can tell you this much: the entity within the vial is potent. It has the power to bind, destroy, or perhaps even protect, depending on how it is commanded. Whoever created these artifacts must have intended them for something monumental.”

Korric grunts, crossing his arms. “Monumental, huh? Doesn’t sound like something we want going off in the middle of town.”

Eldrin nods. “Precisely. Controlling or destroying it without the missing component is possible, but the risks are extraordinary. For now, its containment holds—but I wouldn’t test its patience indefinitely.”

You nod thoughtfully, meeting Eldrin’s gaze. “If the missing piece is key to controlling this safely, can you help us figure out where to find it? Any clue about what we’re looking for or where it might be?”

Eldrin strokes his chin, his expression turning contemplative. “The artifacts themselves offer hints, though incomplete ones. The glyphs on the scroll suggest a specific alignment—an anchor, perhaps, or a focus. The missing piece could be another artifact tied to the same ritual, something meant to complete the bond.”

He glances at the vial. “It’s possible the entity inside was meant to be bound in a particular location. If so, the final component might reside near where these were found—or where they were intended to go.”

Eldrin moves to a shelf, pulling down a tattered tome. Flipping through the pages, he gestures for you to approach. “Look here. This map outlines places of power in the region—sites where rituals like this might have been performed. The closest is an old ruin in the forest northeast of here. If the missing piece exists, it’s a likely candidate.”

### The Anchor

Inside the Ruin that hauses Anchor:
The interior is dimly lit, with faint light filtering in through cracks in the ceiling. The air is damp, carrying the scent of earth and decay. The room you enter appears to have been a storage area once, with rotted wooden crates and rusted tools scattered around.

Ahead, faint voices echo through the halls—low and hushed, but unmistakably human. The flicker of torchlight dances on the walls, indicating the intruders’ location.


You step out of the shadows, raising your hands in a gesture of peace. “Wait! We don’t mean any harm. We’re here to understand, not disturb.”

The spectral guardian’s glowing eyes snap to you, its weapon lowering slightly. The golden light surrounding it pulses rhythmically as it studies you, its hollow voice resonating through the chamber. “YOU ARE NOT WITH THESE TRESPASSERS?”

Korric emerges behind you, his axe at the ready but lowered. “We’re not,” he says firmly. “We came here to learn about the seal, not to plunder.”

The guardian’s gaze shifts between you and the terrified treasure hunters, its form shimmering faintly. “THE SEAL PROTECTS WHAT SHOULD NOT BE UNLEASHED. WHY HAVE YOU COME?”

You hold the guardian’s gaze, your voice steady. “What is this power you’re protecting? Why was it sealed, and what makes it so dangerous?”

The spectral figure’s form flickers slightly, as though caught between the past and present. Its voice resonates with a somber tone. “IT IS AN ENTITY OF PURE MAGIC, A BEING WITHOUT FORM OR CONSCIENCE. IT WAS CREATED IN A TIME OF GREAT DESPERATION, TO WIELD DESTRUCTIVE POWER AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO DOMINATE.”

It lowers its weapon slightly, the glow of its form dimming as it continues. “BUT IN THE END, EVEN ITS MAKERS COULD NOT CONTROL IT. THEY FEARED ITS WRATH AS MUCH AS THEIR ENEMIES DID. THIS SEAL WAS THEIR SOLUTION—TO BIND THE ENTITY HERE FOR ETERNITY, UNLEASHED ONLY BY THOSE WHO COULD RECONSTRUCT THE RITUAL AND WIELD IT WITH PURE INTENT.”

The guardian’s eyes flare once more. “KNOW THIS: THOSE WHO WOULD RELEASE THIS POWER WITHOUT PURPOSE WILL BRING RUIN UPON THEMSELVES AND ALL THEY TOUCH. DO YOU SEEK THIS POWER?”

 The ruins were a labyrinth of trials, each tied to themes of Resolve, Balance, and Intent. I passed each test, though they demanded not just physical effort but emotional and mental fortitude.
At the heart of the ruins, I found the Anchor—a crystalline gauntlet that resonated with my very thoughts and emotions. Claiming it was not simply a matter of possession; it forged a connection between me and an ancient, sealed entity.

The Anchor granted me incredible abilities tied to three aspects: Offense (Red Aspect), Defense (Green Aspect), and Precision (Blue Aspect). However, Eldrin warned that this power is a double-edged sword. The gauntlet’s energy demands balance, and misuse could shatter the seal holding the entity in check.

After claiming the Anchor, Korric and I exited the ruins. The weight of what we’d uncovered—both the gauntlet and the secrets of the trials—was heavy. 

Location: Eldrin’s Workshop
Eldrin studied the vial and scroll we recovered. He identified the vial as containing a living essence, bound and malevolent. The scroll detailed a ritual to unlock the vial’s power. This ritual, however, is incomplete, and its cost—both physical and spiritual—is immense. Eldrin theorized that the Anchor would be critical to stabilizing the ritual, acting as a bridge to control the essence.

Eldrin connected the vial and scroll to the sealed doors in the chapel where Sundered Legion has their bases. The site, unknowingly occupied by the Legion, is the ritual’s intended location. These doors guard a chamber that could unleash or bind the essence, depending on how the ritual is performed. The Legion, unaware of its significance, remains a wildcard in this unfolding situation.

I resolved to perform the ritual when the time is right, but I need to understand the price. For now, I’ve left the vial and scroll with Eldrin for further study. Korric and I agreed to report back to Mask, knowing we’ll need her guidance and resources to proceed.
