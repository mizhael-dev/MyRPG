### Attack Hit Chance
Attack Hit or miss is decided by a single d100 dice roll

**Hit probability formula:**
Base Chance = 75%
Modifiers:
- Attacker's Agility and Accuracy
- Defender's Agility and Evade
- Environmental factors (e.g. cover, visibility, unstable ground)
- Hit Difficulty Check (Hit DC) = 100 - ( Base chance + Attacker's Agility + Attacker's Accuracy - Defender's Evade - Enviromental Factors)
- Roll a d100. If the result is equal or higher than Hit DC, the attack hits
- If the result is lower than Hit DC, the attack hits

**Calculation Example:**
- Attacker's Agility: 15
- Attacker's Accuracy: 10
- Defender's Evade: 11
- Defender's Evade: 12
- Enviromental factors: Dark -5
- Modified Hit Probability: 100 - (75 + 15 + 10 - 11 - 12 - 5) = 28
- Roll a d100. If the result is equal or higher than Hit DC, th attack hits
- If the result is lower than Hit DC, the attack hits

---

### Damage Calculation
- Base Damage = Weapon Damage + (0.1 * Strength Attribute)

- Modifiers:
  - Critical Hits: Multiply damage by 1.5.
  - Environmental or situational bonuses/penalties.

## Character Attributes

### Agility Attribute

#### Agility Attribute in combat
Agility Attribute is added to Accuracy and Evade

### Speed Attribute 
Speed Attribute indicates how fast a character is.

#### Speed Attribute Table

This table defines the effect of Speed attribute for characters, grouped in ranges of 5 (e.g., from 1 to 5, from 6 to 10).
**Description:** It incudes descriptions to give context how fast the character is.
**Actions per turn:** Dictates how many actions a character can take compared to other characters involved in combat.
**Top Speed Sprinting (km/h):** It includes speed in km/h to get a better sense of the travel speed.
**Top Speed Distance Traveled in 1 Second (m):** The table also includes the distance traveled in 1 second, calculated based on the sprinting speed. Distance Traveled in 1 second is useful for DM, to decide how far characters can reposition in combat.
