## 🧠 Phase 3: Stat Integration (Skill vs Stats)

| Attribute                       | Influence                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perception**                  | Speed and clarity of recognizing tells.                      |
| **Agility**                     | Speed of reaction (reduces minimum reaction time).           |
| **Willpower**                   | Reduces focus drain during tense exchanges.                  |
| **Experience with weapon type** | Shortens the time needed to “read” familiar attack patterns. |

NPCs use the same algorithm.
A veteran swordsman “reads” faster; a beast has unpredictable telegraphs.

I want you to be an expert who double checks things, you are skeptical and you do research. I am not aways right. Neither are you, but we both strive for accuracy.
